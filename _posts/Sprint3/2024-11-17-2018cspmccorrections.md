# Q14
![Q14.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Sprint3/2018mccorrections/q14.png)

*Why Option C is Correct:*
Both programs display the same number of values. Each displays 10 values because the loop condition (i > 10) stops both loops after the same number of iterations.
However, the values displayed are different.
- Program A displays 1 through 10.
- Program B displays 2 through 11.

*Why the Other Options Are Incorrect:*
Option A: "Program A and program B display identical values."
- This is incorrect because the starting and ending values differ. Program A starts at 1 and ends at 10, whereas Program B starts at 2 and ends at 11.

Option B: "Program A and program B display the same values in different orders."
- This is incorrect because both programs display values in the same order (ascending), but the actual values differ.

Option D: "Program A and program B display a different number of values."
- This is incorrect because both programs display exactly 10 values.

# Q39
![Q39.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Sprint3/2018mccorrections/q39.png)

*Why Option A is Correct:*
Open standards and protocols benefit Internet communication because they:
- Allow different manufacturers and developers to work together across the Internet.
- Create a more unified and functional system.

*Why the Other Options Are Incorrect:*
Option B: "Open standards and protocols provide ways for users to eliminate the latency of messages they send on the Internet."
- This is incorrect because open standards do not directly reduce or eliminate latency. 

Option C: "Open standards and protocols allow users to freely share or reuse material found on the Internet for noncommercial purposes."
- This is incorrect because open standards do not control the licensing or sharing of content on the Internet.

Option D: "Open standards and protocols prevent developers from releasing software that contains errors."
- This is incorrect because open standards do not enforce error prevention in software development.

# Q43
![Q43.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Sprint3/2018mccorrections/q43.png)

*Why Option A is Correct:*
- The algorithm's steps grow in the form of a polynomial with the number of items (`n²` growth rate). 

*Why the Other Options Are Incorrect:*

**Option B:**  
- Incorrect because the growth rate is quadratic (`n²`), not exponential, and thus remains efficient for practical input sizes.

**Option C:**  
- Incorrect because the problem is decidable since it's sorting.

**Option D:**  
- Incorrect because the algorithm is exact, not approximate.

# Q50
![Q50.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Sprint3/2018mccorrections/q50.png)

*Why Option B is Correct:*
- Performs a linear search, meaning it compares each element of the list with the intended target value

*Why the Other Options Are Incorrect:*

**Option A:**  
- Doesn't implement a binary search

**Option C:**  
- Doesn't implement a binary search and doesn't require the list to be sorted

**Option D:**  
- Doesn't require the list to be sorted

# Q54
![Q54.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Sprint3/2018mccorrections/q54.png)

*Why Option D is Correct:*
- The generalization is correct of power n to the m, because the same effect can be seen in square and cube

*Why the Other Options Are Incorrect:*

**Option A:**  
- "Add" doesn't generalize Square and Cube procedures

**Option B:**  
- Fourth procedure doesn't generalize the calculation of the ability to calculate any power of n

**Option C:**  
- Although the Polynomial procedure properly adds Square and Cube, doesn't generalize any power of n

# Q58
![Q58.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Sprint3/2018mccorrections/q58.png)

*Why Option A is Correct:*
- The internet does indeed provide tools, information, and professional knowledge to participants of crowdsourcing, and does provide a better reach to those with geographic barriers. However, the internet may not always solve problems with reasonable time.

# Q65
![Q65.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Sprint3/2018mccorrections/q65.png)

*Why Option B and D are Correct:*
- If Y is negative, then the condition will never be met of count = y because count = 0 is reset every time.

*Why the Other Options Are Incorrect:*

- If both x and y are positive, the procedure will proceed correctly by adding x y times to itself.

Overall, this multiple choice quiz took me an hour and 27 minutes, and I feel that it was a successful first attempt! I will make my best effort to continue improving my score and also understanding the content better.
