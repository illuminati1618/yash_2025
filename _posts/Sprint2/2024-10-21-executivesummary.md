In this executive summary, I meticulously covered homework assignments, detailing how each task was accomplished and presented. I also showcased my active participation in the grading process, emphasizing constructive feedback and fair assessments.

I also focused on organizing my home page to show the growth in my learnings overall, such as the extremely difficult table to work with.

Reflecting on the teaching process, it was transformative because I developed better communication and leadership skills while coordinating with my peers. This experience allowed me to critically evaluate instructional methods and improve upon them. For example, I created the idea and implementation for my group to have a breakdown.

Individually, completing the homework enhanced my understanding and application of various topics. I went above and beyond with my contributions, ensuring high-quality outputs and unique additions.

I was involved in the:
- Splitting of each lesson in bite-sized pieces to make lesson easily understandable
- See answer button that allows for people to ensure their code is up to standards and matches the correct output
- Displaying of javascript code using HTML outputting

Additionally, one of my main growths was being one of the only people to follow up with my peer reviewer. 
This involved the process of:
1. Contacting my peer reviewer who I initially had trouble contacting (I then contacted her through a friend)
2. Explaining to my peer reviewer how the reviewing process should be including providing her with the checklist and guidelines on what I should look to improve on
3. Accepting my peer reviewers feedback and implementing it into our lesson

4. Peer reviewing the 3.2 group in period 3 and providing them thorough advice for how to improve

My involvement with GitHub and the Nighthawk pages portfolio as a whole including creating pull requests for our group that merged properly with the main repo. I also had to help a lot of groups with GitHub problems as well as working on their own pull requests:

My learnings here were especially crucial because one of the most important things I learned was how to use the right data type for the right use case. I tried to display my learnings overall through my final Blackjack game:

I worked consistently throughout the lesson development process and coming up with unique ideas. While doing all of this I was managing the rest of the class as super scrum for my period.

Overall, the combination of teaching and learning provided a comprehensive growth experience, boosting both my personal and professional skills.
