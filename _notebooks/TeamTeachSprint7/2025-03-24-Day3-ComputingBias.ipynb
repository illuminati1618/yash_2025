    "The answer is B. When you create a Netflix account, you provide your name, age, and preferences. This is an example of explicit data because you are explicitly providing information about yourself. Netflix uses this information to recommend shows based on your preferences, but those are explicitly defined by the user."

In this case, the dataset used to train the system lacks diversity and underrepresents certain groups, leading to biased outcomes. This can result in unfair treatment or discrimination against those groups."
